# About
---
Main Purpose:
In this mod, there are two diffrent types of new doors. The keycard door, and the ticket door (each opened with the ticket/keycard respectfully). In admin/creative mode, both of these doors create a 2 by 1 door which can only be opened with its respective key. To make this door, clear out a two block land. Then build up one block and place the scanner, therefor, if you do it right, the door should automatically build to it's right (This depends on the axis you are facing. The door is NOT userconfiged and will be placed facing north). Then, everything is complete. Just make sure not to place it to the ground or else the door will build partly inside it. Finally, to open the door at amy time, just make sure you have the keycard / ticket inside your inventory before right clicking. Then, the door should open and close (with a three second delay).

Note:
Also in this mod, the ticket can be crafted with one diamond and a sheet of paper. So when building on a public server, keep in mind that anyone who has been mining will probobly be able to open this door.
